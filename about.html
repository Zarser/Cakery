            <h2>Our Beginnings</h2>
            <p>
                Munamii Cakery was established in 2020, born from a passion for baking and a desire to bring joy to special occasions. The journey began when our founder, inspired by the simple pleasure that sweets can bring, decided to turn her love for baking into a business that would celebrate life's sweetest moments.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea behind Munamii Cakery blossomed during a close friend’s wedding, where the search for the perfect wedding cake turned into a memorable experience. Frustrated by the limited options available and the often generic designs, she envisioned a bakery that would not only create exquisite wedding cakes but also offer unique, personalized flavors that reflect individual tastes and stories.

            <p>
                Recognizing the growing trend for fun and interactive dessert options, Munamii Cakery also introduced cupcakes as a delightful addition to its menu. Cupcakes, with their charming individual servings, became an ideal solution for various occasions, from intimate weddings to vibrant birthday celebrations.
